Volcano
A hill or mountain constructed from the accumulation of lavas and other erupted materials.
Volcanism
All of the geologic processes that give rise to volcanoes and volcanic rocks.
Magma
Sub Terranean Lava (Melted Rocks)
Lava
Magma that is on earths surface
Rhyolite
A felsic Igneous rock
Andesite
An Intermediate Igneous rock
Basalt
A Mafic Igneous rock
Pillow Lava
Basaltic lava that form under water, especially along the mid atlantic ridge. Mafic Lava formed by low, slow flows.
Columnar Joints
Six sided coulmns that form when basalt cools and contracts.
Lava Tubes
One or many series of tunnel like conduits that lavas once had or are currently flowing through. Usually lava with very, very low viscosity. Some are miles long.
Glassy
A certain texture of an igneous rock that is created when hot lava cools quickly.
Vesicular
A certain texture used to describe an igneous rock with small vesicules, or hole like tubes, in it. Some vesicules can be very large.
Aphinitic
A certain texture used to describe an igneous rock with a fast cooling rate and visible crystals.
Pyroclast
A rock fragment ejected into the air by a volcanic eruption. (Classified by their size)
Ejecta
Ash, Gas, and anything that can flow downhill.
Ash
Very small particles of glass that are ejected into the atmosphere and then slowly rain down.
Bombs
Large clasts thrown into the air that land close to the volcanoe. Can be the size of a bus.
Tuff
Pieces of lava and ash welded together with heat.
Flows
(sic). See Ejecta
Central Eruptions
Lava and/or pyroclasts discharged from a central vent
Central Vent
An opening at the top of a volcano. A pipe like feeder channel that is the main point for release for the lava chamber.
